"""Layer 2 — the whole-protocol grade fold. Pure, read-only, deterministic.

The fold is a recompute, never an accumulator. Three facts make a running total
wrong: value is MAX per (entity, asset) so two contracts reaching one vault must
charge it once; principal units are cross-contract and get RE-KEYED when a later
contract reveals an owner overlap; and which finding subsumes which is only
decidable with the whole finding set present.

Its population is the signal plane and nothing else — read through the one
pinned, totally ordered query — plus the resolution planes in
:mod:`services.scoring.planes`, which is where a reference becomes a unit, a
dollar or a breadth floor.

THE ROOT RULE
-------------
**Never substitute an available field for an unread one.** Every ``x or y`` on a
nullable or three-state expression is that substitution written as an idiom: an
owner set that did not resolve is not the threshold, an unread delay is not zero,
an unpriced entity is not ``$0.00``, and a principal address is not its own owner
set unless the principal IS a key. Where a witness is missing the answer is the
uncredited rung, an explicit ``None``, or a withheld row — chosen so the mistake
costs a credit rather than fabricating one. Every remaining fallback in this
module is guarded by a proof that the substituted value IS the fact.

Every arithmetic branch fails closed. A signal whose severity was not proven is
not scored; a value that could not be priced falls to the unpriced branch rather
than to zero; a malformed gate envelope withholds its own row rather than
raising out of the whole fold.

    """Monotone in resolution work: the denominator is the PERIMETER.

    The perimeter's base population is the protocol's ``contracts`` rows, unioned
    with the value plane and the control closure. Discovery fixes that base, so it
    does not move with what has been analysed — losing a contract's signals cannot
    drop its unanswered weight out of its own denominator — while an unpriced
    contract outside the closure still carries ``band(None)`` of unanswered
    weight rather than vanishing. Seeding it from the signal population instead
    is what let LESS analysis publish MORE confidence. Three figures, and the
    headline is the MINIMUM — knowing who can call something, knowing what it
    does, and being able to price what it reaches are different questions.

    Every key is admitted through ``value_plane.canonical``: an implementation
    is the same entity as the proxy that deploys it, and admitting both hands
    the impl a second copy of the proxy's value band that no signal can ever
    answer (signals are distilled at the proxy address). The alias map comes
    from the same discovery-fixed ``contracts`` rows as the base population, so
    folding through it keeps the denominator independent of analysis. The zero
    address is excluded outright — it is a burn sentinel, not an assessable
    entity (``msg.sender != 0x0``). A perimeter entity proven codeless
    (``resolved_type == 'eoa'``, earned from an empty ``eth_getCode``) has no
    capability surface to leave unanswered: its reach and capability terms are
    vacuously answered, while its pricing term is untouched — holding value is
    a question code-lessness does not answer.
